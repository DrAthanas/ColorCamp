The strategic use of color in branding, marketing, and data analytics is a powerful tool that elicits emotions and simplifies comprehension of complex information. Color choice influences how audiences feel about your message, and it can make intricate data more accessible. ColorCamp is a pythonic way of dealing with colors, palettes, mappings, and scales, and by storing human readable metadata allow more cohesive color choices.  

> A group of geese is a gaggle, an assembly of musicians is a band, a collective of lions is a pride. This package introduces that a collection of colors is a camp! Welcome to Color Camp!

## Core tenets
* Provide additional context to colors so they can be used to convey consistent information
* The colors should be immediately recognized by other applications (e.g. a string, tuple, or dictionary) without additional calls
* Easy to import/export to and from multiple sources and frameworks
* Be as lightweight and portable as possible with minimal to no dependencies
